<ul><strong> Ingredients</strong>
<li> Chicken Thighs</li>
<li> Cornflour</li>
<li> Flour</li>
<li> Egg</li>
<li> Garlic Salt</li>
<li> Salt</li>
<li> Pepper</li>

<li> Soy Sauce</li>
<li> Garlic</li>
<li> Ginger</li>
<li> Sugar</li>

</ul>
<ol> <strong>How to cook the chicken</strong>
    <li> We make the batter for the chicken first by mixing flour, egg, garlic salt, salt, pepper and water. Then in a separate bowl, we coat the chicken in cornflour, and add the chicken into the batter. Give it a stir to coat. </li>
    <li> Then we fry the chicken in a wok in the hot oil. My pro tip is to fry the chicken in 2 or 3 batches - this ensures all of the chicken will be lovely and crispy.</li>
</ol>
<ol><strong>How to make the sauce</strong>
    <li> The orange sauce is made from a mixture of the orange juice and zest, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and rice vinegar.</li>
    <Li> This is bubbled up in the wok until slightly thickened.</Li>
    <li> The chicken is then added back in, and tossed in the sauce until fully coated.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Want to make it spicy?</strong>Add a tablespoon of sriracha to the sauce and sprinkle with a few chilli flakes before serving.</p>
<p>Serve the chicken over boiled rice, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
