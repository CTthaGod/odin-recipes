<p> Buttery Chicken Curry is an Indian Cuisine which is sure to be a hit!</p>
<p> Chicken Curry is our GO TO  when a little of extra comfort is needed. We always call in for an order of curry when we come home after travelling. But why order out when you can make it yourself!</p>
<ul> <strong> Ingredients</strong>
<li> plain yogurt</li>
<li> fresh garlic</li>
<li> Ginger</li>
<li> Spices: Garam masala, tumeric, cumin, red chili powder, salt</li>
<li> Boneless Chicken Thighs (cubed) </li>
<li> Onion</li>
<li> Crushed Tomato</li>
<li> Heavy whipping cream</li>
</ul>
<ol> 
<li> First, mix your yogurt marinade together.(plain yogurt, garlic, ginger, spices) </li>
<li> Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)</li>
<li> Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.</li>
<li> Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
</ol>
<ol> Curry Sauce
<li> Cook tomatoes in sauce pan for 10-15 minutes with diced onions</li>
<li> After that, blend until smooth and add in your cream</li>
</ol>
<p> Combine the sauce over the cooked chicken, serve over basmati rice and garlic naan bread!</p>
<p> <strong> Enjoy!</strong></p>
